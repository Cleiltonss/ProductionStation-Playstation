## Project Overview

The manufacturing line automates the production of Playstation consoles, optimizing processes for efficiency and scalability. Key stages include:

1. **Raw Material Reception and Unpacking**: Materials are processed from medium and large boxes into the production line.
2. **Machining**: Raw materials are transformed into intermediate components such as displays and bases.
3. **Intermediate Storage**: Components are stored temporarily for optimized workflow.
4. **Assembly**: Displays and bases are combined into the final product.
5. **Quality Testing**: Units undergo rigorous tests to ensure functionality.
6. **Packaging and Shipping**: Approved products are packed and dispatched.
